# Netherlands Visa Sponsorship Checker â€” IND List Extension

A browser extension that helps jobseekers and recruiters on LinkedIn quickly identify companies recognized by the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) as visa sponsors for regular labor and highly skilled migrants.

## Features

- **Badge Injection:** Automatically adds a "has sponsorship" badge next to company names on LinkedIn job and company pages if the company is on the official IND sponsorship list.
- **Company Info Dialog:** Clicking the badge opens a dialog showing the company's full name and IND registration ID (KvnID).
- **Auto-Update Sponsor List:** Periodically fetches the latest IND recognized sponsors from the official public register.
- **Enable/Disable Toggle:** Popup UI toggle to enable or disable the extension's functionality.

## How it works

1. The extension fetches and caches a JSON list of recognized IND sponsors from [ind.nl](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants).
2. On LinkedIn job listings and company pages, it scans company names.
3. If a company matches an IND sponsor, it injects a green sponsorship badge next to the company name.
4. Clicking the badge opens a modal with company sponsorship details.
